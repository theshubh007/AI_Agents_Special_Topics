## 📋 Assignment Overview

This repository contains implementations practicing MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols through Google ADK codelabs. The assignment involves reproducing three codelabs and providing all artifacts with video walkthroughs demonstrating their execution.

**Assignment Goals:**
- Practice MCP and A2A protocols
- Create multi-agent systems using ADK
- Deploy agents in Agent Engine
- Implement currency conversion and purchasing concierge agents
