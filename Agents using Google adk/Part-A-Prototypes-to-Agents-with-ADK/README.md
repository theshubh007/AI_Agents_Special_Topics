# Building Autonomous Agents with ADK ü§ñ

## Overview
This directory showcases the implementation for the Google ADK Codelab focused on evolving simple prompt-based AI prototypes into sophisticated, autonomous agent systems. The codelab walks through creating a single-agent architecture using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini models to tackle practical business challenges.

## üéØ Project Mission: Kitchen Renovation Proposal Generator
This implementation builds an intelligent autonomous agent capable of creating detailed Kitchen Renovation Proposal Documents on demand and persisting them to Google Cloud Storage without human intervention.

## üìö Learning Outcomes
Through this hands-on codelab, you'll master:

- Architecting goal-driven AI Agents with Vertex AI's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Organizing Python-based agentic projects (including agent.py, .env, and requirements.txt)
- Embedding custom Tools into agents (such as Cloud Storage file persistence utilities)
- Designing a root agent to coordinate single-agent workflows
- Configuring development environments within Google Cloud Shell and deploying agents

## üîß Required Prerequisites
Ensure you have these essentials ready:

- Active Google Cloud Project with billing configured
- Google Cloud Shell access (strongly recommended for consistency)
- Vertex AI API activated in your project
- Pre-configured Google Cloud Storage Bucket for document storage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Virtual Environment
```bash
# Establish root workspace for agent projects
mkdir agentic-apps
cd agentic-apps

# Set up project-specific directory
mkdir renovation-agent
cd renovation-agent

# Initialize Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Enable the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages
```bash
# Add Google Agent Development Kit
pip install google-adk

# For additional project dependencies:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in your `renovation-agent/` directory with the following configuration:

```bash
# Example .env configuration:

# 1. Cloud Platform Settings
# Your unique Google Cloud Project identifier
PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"

# 2. Model Configuration
# Specify the language model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash)
MODEL_NAME="gemini-2.5-flash"

# 3. Storage Tool Settings
# Target Cloud Storage Bucket for proposal documents
GCS_BUCKET_NAME="your-proposal-storage-bucket"
```

**Important:** Verify that your Google Cloud service account has appropriate permissions (such as Storage Object Creator role) to enable the agent's file storage capabilities.

- **inputKitchenImage.png** - Sample input image showing the current kitchen state used as reference for the renovation proposal
- **OutputKitchenImage.png** - Generated output visualization demonstrating the agent's processing results
- **proposal_document_for_user.pdf** - Example of the final Kitchen Renovation Proposal Document generated by the autonomous agent


## üí° Key Takeaways
This codelab demonstrates the transformation from basic AI prototypes to production-ready autonomous agents, highlighting the power of structured agent frameworks and tool integration for solving real-world document generation and storage challenges.
