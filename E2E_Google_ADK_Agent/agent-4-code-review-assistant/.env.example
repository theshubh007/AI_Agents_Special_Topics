# NOTES ON DEPLOYMENT & SESSION PERSISTENCE
# ============================================================================

# This project has three distinct run/deployment modes, each with its own
# session handling method.

# 1. Local Development (`./deploy.sh local`):
#    - Uses a purely IN-MEMORY session service.
#    - State is EPHEMERAL and is completely lost when the server is stopped.
#    - Fastest option for quick, iterative testing. No cloud resources needed.

# 2. Cloud Run Production (`./deploy.sh cloud-run`):
#    - Deploys the agent as a stateless container on Cloud Run.
#    - Session state is PERSISTENT and stored in a Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) database.
#    - Requires CLOUD_SQL_* variables to be set. The script will help you create
#      the database on the first run. This is the recommended production architecture
#      for a decoupled web service.

# 3. Agent Engine Deployment (`./deploy.sh agent-engine`):
#    - Deploys the agent to a fully managed, stateful service.
#    - Session state is PERSISTENT and automatically handled by the Agent Engine's
#      built-in VertexAiSessionService.
#    - Requires the AGENT_ENGINE_ID for updates. This is the simplest path to a
#      managed, stateful agent endpoint.
